When this is enabled, inheritance project will hide the "Archive the artifacts"
post-build action. This action is dangerous, as it allows builds to swamp the
Jenkins server with artifacts, leading to a potential server outage.

<b>NOTE:</b> Only enable this, if you know what you are doing and can offer your
users a different, safer archiver.
